# Smart-Agriculture
Smart Agriculture is an AI-powered platform that helps farmers optimize agricultural productivity and sustainability. It provides insights based on real-time data such as weather, soil health, and moisture levels, enabling smarter decisions for irrigation, fertilization, and crop management.

# Smart Agriculture

A multi-part smart farming system with:

- 🌱 **Frontend** (Angular) – Provides the user interface for farmers and admins.
- ⚙️ **Backend** (.NET) – Web API handling data, authentication, and backend services.
- 🤖 **AI** (LLMs) – AI-powered features such as crop recommendations and weather analysis.

## Folders
- **`frontend/`**: Angular app for the user interface.
- **`backend/`**: .NET Web API for backend logic and database.
- **`ai/`**: Python-based AI scripts and models (LLM integration).

## Setup (Manual Steps)
1. Open each folder (`frontend`, `backend`, `ai`) individually.
2. Follow the `README.md` file inside each folder for setup instructions.
3. Make sure all parts are running to experience the full system.
